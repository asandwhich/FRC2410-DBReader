FRC2410-DBReader
================

Opens and sorts the databases produced by the FRC scouting server. In it's current state it is effectively
a SQLite3 database reader. Improved functionality will come with time.

There is a runnable executable for windows in the folder labeled executables. It currently lacks the window icons,
which you can fix by just building the application. Linux, OSX, and Net-BSD binaries will happen eventually.
